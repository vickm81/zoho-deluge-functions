Zoho Deluge Functions Repository

This repository contains custom Deluge functions for automating various actions across Zoho applications. The functions are designed to streamline workflows, improve efficiency, and integrate Zoho services seamlessly.

About

This project is part of my journey as I take the Zoho Developer and Integrator course by Workflow Academy. I will be uploading different Deluge functions as I learn and implement automation for various Zoho applications such as Zoho CRM, Zoho Inventory, Zoho Books, and more.
